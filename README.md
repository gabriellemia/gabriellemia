Hi there 🙋‍♀️

- 🔭 I’m currently learning to code using The Odin Project and have just enrolled in the School of Code skills bootcamp, so for the next 16 weeks I'll be getting my coding skills polished to industry standard and ready to start a new career in tech!
- 📚 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS and Javascript.
- 💬 Ask me about anything tech related. I'm eager to cram in as much info as my brain can handle!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I failed IT in school and before 2020 had no noteworthy skills in tech whatsoever.  In fact I actually hated the thought of having to use a computer for more than browsing the web.  Now I can't wait to solve the next coding problem!

- 💻 Though I have been learning to code since 2020, I will be updating my coding journey here from now on if you want to follow it...
