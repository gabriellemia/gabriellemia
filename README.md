Hi there 🙋‍♀️

- 🚀 I’m a self taught developer and, more recently, a School of Code bootcamp graduate! So for the past 16 weeks I have been building and refining my technical skills in all areas of development and getting industry prepared, ready to launch into a new career in tech!
- 💻 Some of my technical skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React, SQL, Express, TypeScript, TDD, CI/CD, DevOps, Cyber Security, Data and AI. The list is not exhaustive, I continue to grow and learn new things daily!
- 💬 Ask me about anything tech related. I'm eager to learn as much as I can and delve into topics known and unknown. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I failed IT in school and before 2020 had no noteworthy skills in tech whatsoever.  In fact I actually hated the thought of having to use a computer for more than browsing the web.  Now I can't wait to solve the next coding problem!

- 🗞️ Though I have been learning to code since 2020, I will be updating my coding journey here from now on if you want to follow it...
